Promises
This project makes use of JavaScript Promises to handle asynchronous operations when fetching data from external APIs. 
Promises are utilized to ensure that the application waits for the data to be fetched before proceeding with displaying it on the page. 
By using Promises, the code remains organized and readable, and it efficiently manages asynchronous tasks without blocking the main thread.
